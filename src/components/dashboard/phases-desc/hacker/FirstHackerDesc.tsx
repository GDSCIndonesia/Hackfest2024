			<p>Greetings, Master Hackers!</p>

			<p>
				We welcome you to the ultimate Hackers Challenge where your skills will
				be put to the test. In this clandestine mission, you are required to
				create both a <strong>Use Case Diagram</strong> and a{" "}
				<strong>Sequence Diagram</strong> for the solution that your team is
				building. Your objective is to unravel the intricacies of the
				system&apos;s functionality and expose its hidden features.
			</p>

			<h2>Submission Guidelines:</h2>

			<p>
				<strong>Single Link:</strong> Please ensure that your submission is a
				single link leading directly to your Use Case Diagram and Sequence
				Diagram. We value your time, and this streamlined approach will allow us
				to focus on your innovation.
			</p>

			<p>
				We suggest you to submit your file in a single .zip file. If you use a
				cloud platform like Draw.io, you can export or download your creation
				and zip it all into a single file.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Submission Deadline:</strong> 02 January 2024
			</p>
